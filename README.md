carlweather
===========

A weather service for Carleton College built on the Android platform. Currently, since the website that CarlWeather pulls data from has been overhauled after the project was completed, the "Sun" tab is not currently working, nor is the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion feature. However, all other data is accurate.
