carlweather
===========

A weather service for Carleton College built on the Android platform. Pulls data from an RSS feed based at the college and displays it for the user. Also pulls information from the web page associated with the RSS feed in order to display graphs of recent weather trends, among other things.


Known issues:
Currently, since the website that CarlWeather pulls data from has been overhauled after the project was completed, the "Sun" tab is not currently working, nor is the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion feature. However, all other data is accurate.
